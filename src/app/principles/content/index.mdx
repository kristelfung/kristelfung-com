1. Act with integrity and stay reliable. It'll be hard to fail at anything you want.
2. Mind and body are connected. A healthy body fuels a healthy mind and vice versa.
3. Trust compounding.
4. Delayed gratification is the true source of fulfillment.
5. Avoid irreversible decisions (one way doors). If you can't, you better have conviction.
6. Everything comes at a cost. What comes up must come down (laws of nature).
7. There is no such thing as mistakes, only decisions with consequences. The only mistake is not learning from the consequences of your decisions.
8. Trust your intuition and follow your heart. You can't connect the dots looking forwards, only looking back.
9. Stay instrumental and keep your identity small.
