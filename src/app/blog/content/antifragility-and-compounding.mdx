title: antifragility and compounding

In times of non-linear growth, probability of collateral damage increases. Assumptions that held true in the past break down, and pre-existing systems may not be able to support new developments.

Being antifragile is crucial in these times. To be antifragile is to avoid making critical decisions based on prediction; it is to position yourself to gain from disorder.

To make this concept less abstract, you can ask yourself, “what do I know for sure?” One fundamental truth I know: trust compounding.

Human brains (mine included) find it difficult to picture compounded growth. Thus, it is difficult to grasp the dividends that come from compounding. Fundamentally though, I know the payoffs are greater than I can imagine.

What compounds? Knowledge compounds, kindness compounds, relationships compound, and health compounds. And I recently came to the realization that **optionality** compounds. I feel this is less talked about, actually—the most common three I hear about is knowledge, relationships, and money. This revelation is quite timely, as I'm moving from limited decision trees of academic life to larger branching factors of post-graduation choice.

Optionality is critical to becoming antifragile. Options cascade exponentially as a decision tree. The more doors you start with, the more possible outcomes you have at the end. Options are different from decisions—I have the **option**, but not the **obligation** to choose a path. So better to have the option in the first place.

It's the second half of 2025, and I'm moving back to the bay. Being in San Francisco creates optionality at a low cost (except moving all my shit I guess), but I think it's about time to go home.
